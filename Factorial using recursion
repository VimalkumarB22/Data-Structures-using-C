int main(){

int s = 7;

printf(“If we calculate the factorial of the given variable s, the output generated would be equal to: %d”, fact(s));

return 0;

}

// The recursive function used in the to find factorial of s

int fact(int t){

if (t == 0)

return 1;

return t * fact(t – 1);

}

The output generated from the code mentioned above would be:

If we calculate the factorial of the given variable s, the output generated would be equal to: 5040
